This React Native application includes bottom tab navigation with custom icons, offering a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. The app is structured to have multiple screens: Home, Card, Statistics, and Settings, all accessible through the bottom tab navigator.

Installation
To get started, you first need to clone the repository using the command: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git. Navigate into the project directory with cd your-repo-name. Next, install the necessary dependencies using npm install. Since the application utilizes custom icons, you also need to install the react-native-vector-icons library via npm install react-native-vector-icons. If you are using React Native CLI, link the vector icons with npx react-native link react-native-vector-icons. Finally, you can run the application on an Android or iOS device using npx react-native run-android or npx react-native run-ios, respectively.

Usage
Upon running the application, you'll see a bottom tab navigator with four tabs: Home, Card, Statistics, and Settings. You can switch between these screens by tapping on the respective tab icons, allowing for easy navigation within the app.
